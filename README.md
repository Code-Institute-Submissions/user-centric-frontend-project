## UX

The website is made ultimately for gym, to grab the user attention and show them the value they will receive from the company.
With the contrast of differnt worm colors such as orange it gives the feeling of warmt, confort and welcome to the user.
Moreover, different sections are used such as features to give the user sure to become a member. 
 
### Goal

-The main goal is to make visitors subscribe.

### Pages

##### Landing page

The landing page is made with different purposes, to grab the user attention and take action in terms of subscription.

The Button (Subscribe Now) Brings the user to a Google forms page, where the Gym company can follow up with its lead.

##### Features

The feature section is mainly developed to detail what are the features the company has and what are their price.

##### Testimonials

The testimonial section is the section in which the gym has a more personal approach with the website user. 
Two different users and a personal trainer left their terstimony to detail their experience, succes history and impressions with the gym.
So, future users may remove their objections and subscribe/join the Gym service. 

##### Linear gradients

- > Features : background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #fa709a 0%, #fee140 100%); A worm and strong color to keep the attention throught the website and feel welcome as well as triggered to be part of the gym.
- > Video Section : background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, #f6d365 0%, #fda085 100%); A worm but different linear gradient from the feature section. It was made purpositaly to keep the attention of the reader and not keep he or she tired. 
- > footer : background-image: linear-gradient(-20deg, #2b5876 0%, #4e4376 100%); different from the entire section. A could color to contrast and bring the attention to the reader.
 

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature that I am learning and I would like to implement is a emailed follow-up for high-ticket sales. 
- Once a user is subscribed and/or member of the gym, the follow up can bring them to different levels of value within the company until reach the high-ticket sale.
- Which could be a personal-trainer or a high-level training bootcamp costing â‚¬1000+.

### How the website was tested?

I used the Chrome developer tool and Responsinator.com to test the website in different screens and my iPhone 6 to know whether the outcomes were working. I tryed different websites to try different screens, however not having the real outcome.
I had some issues to fix such as @media queries with (max/min-device-width) that wasn't allowing media queries be accepted to these websites. Therefore, I changed these media queries from (max/min-device-width) to (max/min-width) and the changes I made worked well appearing all of the changes with not issues.

If you need to test the resposiveness of the website yourself you can use the same tools I used:

- > Chrome Developer Tools:
    1. Click on the website with the right button;
    2. Then click inspect;
    3. Once the Web-developer tools appear, click Ctrl+Shift+M to test the webpage on different screens.

- > Responsinator.com
    1. follow the link responsinator.com;
    2. copy the website link (url) and paste within the field and click go.
    3. The webpage will be displayed in different screens already not needing to change as same as GCDT.

## Deployment
